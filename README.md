    <h1>Dear Future Me,</h1>
    <p>
      I know there kabalo kong pilde ka karong adlawa maong duul na ni sir deon. But remember why you started. Remember the dreams that once set your soul on fire. You're capable of amazing things, and every challenge you face is just another step toward your growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never let failure define you — let it refine you. Keep pushing forward, even when the road is steep. Success isn't about being perfect, it's about being persistent. You've come so far, and you're only getting stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, you’ll look back at these struggles and be proud of how you overcame them. So keep your head up, your heart strong, and your mind focused. Great things are coming.
